Connect sql to backend

The same url can be entered multiple times instead of once

Program will need to create a local MySQL database for the user during the initial setup/installation
    SQLite may be a better solution if we don't need MySQL features
        - MySQL works better if the database needs to hosted on a remote server (allows multiple users to access the same database at once)
        - SQLite works better if the database will be stored locally (only that user will have access to the database)

Some visual cue after pressing download to indicate that the download is happening. So the user doesn't think the site is broken or anything
