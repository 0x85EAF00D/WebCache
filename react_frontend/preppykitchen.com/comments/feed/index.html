					<description><![CDATA[These were a breeze and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious, as promised. I followed the directions for the recipe but cut mine a little thicker and baked seven minutes then flipped the pan around and seven more minutes.  Gorgeous color and texture! 

When they were fresh out of the oven and still very hot I took the sides of two straight knives and lightly tapped/squeezed the edges and ends of each cookie for a more sharper edged look.  I wanted them to look more like the Walker brand shortbread biscuits and it worked like a charm. 

This recipe is going in my favorites.  Only double it if you can afford to eat two batches of cookies in one evening! They’re delicious!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Absolutely delicious! We used white sugar, since that’s what is written in the recipe and then realized that the photo of the ingredients showed brown sugar. We were worried that they might not turn out right, so we checked out the video and saw that John uses white sugar there. Still not sure which sugar is correct, but they were wonderful with white sugar.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is hands-down the best pumpkin whoopie pie recipe ever!  My friends and kids start to request it as soon as September arrives.  This year I made them smaller so I could have more to give out.  I used my 1 TBSP scoop and baked them for 8 minutes.  They were the perfect size!  Thank you for a great recipe, John!]]></description>

It&#039;ll be hard to return to the healthy waffles.]]></description>
