Database setup
    - Websites folder will store the downloaded websites
    - SQL folder contains SQL queries that will access the database (adding/deleting/updating/accessing websites)
    - websites.db is the database file that holds website information
    - database.js contains functions to interact with the database with SQL queries
    - clearDB.js deletes website data so it is not uploaded to GitHub 
        - Do not delete the Websites folder or websites.db, this will break the database.js file
        - Instead, run node clearDB.js in the terminal before pushing to GitHub
        - This will remove database data without deleting the database itself

Installing SQLite
    1. Navigate to database folder in the terminal
    2. Type nmp i sqlite3
    3. Do the same thing to install sqlite3 in the express_backend folder

Viewing the database in VSCode
    1. Search for the extension "SQLite"
    2. Install the first extension (by alexcvss)
    3. Press "Ctrl Shift P" on Windows or "Cmd Shift P" on Mac to open command palette
    4. Type "SQLite: Open Database" (press escape if you need to exit command palette)
    5. Open the Explorer sidebar, and there should now be a bottom tab called "SQLite Explorer"
    6. You can use this to view the database table within VSCode (Will only work when data has been added to the database)

Running SQL queries (useful for testing)
    1. Open the SQLite Explorer
    2. Create a .sql file and type your query
    3. Open the command palette and type "SQLite: Run Query" (or select it from recently used commands)
    4. If it asks to select a database, type "websites.db"
    5. The query result will open up in a new tab
